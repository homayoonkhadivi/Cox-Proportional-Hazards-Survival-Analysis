# Cox-Proportional-Hazards-Survival-Analysis
Welcome to the Survival Analysis Notebook. In this notebook we'll develop risk models using survival data and a combination of linear and non-linear techniques. We'll be using a dataset with survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc). PBC is a progressive disease of the liver caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (cholestasis) that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Our goal will be to understand the effects of different factors on the survival times of the patients. 
Along the way we'll learn about the following topics:  Cox Proportional Hazards 
Data Preprocessing for Cox Models.
